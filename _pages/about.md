Hey! 

During day, I'm a theoretical physicist in computational neuroscience, trying to understand the brain as a dynamical system at the [Neural Information Processing Group](https://www.ni.tu-berlin.de/menue/neural_information_processing_group/) at Technische Universit√§t Berlin. 

I'm also building a brain simulation framework called `neurolib` which you can [check out here](https://github.com/neurolib-dev/neurolib). 

During night, I usually sleep.

You can find more information about my projects on my [GitHub profile page](https://github.com/caglorithm).

I am only able to run this blog because of the incredible achievements of the global open source community providing amazing free software to the world. Please give back whenever you can.

You can reach me via [email](mailto:caglorithm@gmail.com) or via the handle @caglorithm on Telegram and Twitter.

Thanks for visiting! [^1]
